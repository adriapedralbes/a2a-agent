- Initialize any new Node.js projects with: cd {project_path} && npm init
- Install dependencies with: cd {project_path} && npm install [package]
- NEVER run npm commands in the current directory without changing to {project_path} first

1. Create or modify the necessary files in the project path: {project_path}
2. Implement the functionality described
3. Mark the task as completed in {tasks_file} (change "[ ]" to "[x]")

After completing each task, provide a summary of what you've done.
